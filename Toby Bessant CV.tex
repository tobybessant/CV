\section*{Professional Experience}
\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
2018--2019 &{\bf A2Z Cloud | Business Applications Developer.}\\ & Placement year taken as part of my degree. In my role I would be configuring, automating, and integrating various Zoho business applications. Initially I was developing using Zoho's Javascript-based proprietary language, \textit{Deluge}, however by the end of my placement I was developing data-mapping middlewares using NodeJS.\\

2015--2016 &{\bf The Regal Stowmarket | Customer Assisstant.}\\ & Part-time job during college. Responsibilities included selling box office tickets, answering calls, working behind the bar, and helping customers with any issues they may have. Efficient communication was essential due to the fact that there would only be 3 staff members running the cinema at any one time. Being part of a small team meant that I was involved in marketing ideas and am proud to say that their growth led to plans of expansion after my departure.\\

\section*{Skills Profile}
During my degree, I have gained many skills around the key areas of software development. From coding foundations such as algorithms and data structures, to more advanced software design such as SOLID principles and design patterns. I have also had the opportunity to use these skills in many team environments, where we were encouraged to utilise various agile methodologies such as scrum. As a result of my degree I have the ability to confidently and independently tackle new problems, allowing me to learn more every day. With a passion for web development, I have focused my learning on full-stack development - including but not limited to NodeJS,  \newline \newline In 2016 I was able to use the skills I had learnt in an industry environment, automating and integrating business applications for clients. This experience was invaluable as I gained wider business knowledge and put my development and system design skills to practice. I was given quite a high level of responsibility, directly demoing solutions to clients over online meetings to receive feedback and direction for the project. On a personal level this improved my confidence and has helped with my ability to approach new challenges.
