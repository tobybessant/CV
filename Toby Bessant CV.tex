2018--2019 &{\bf A2Z Cloud | Business Applications Developer.}\\ &Placeholder text\\[5pt]
2015--2016 &{\bf The Regal Stowmarket | Customer Assistanct.}\\ &Responsibilities included selling box office tickets, answering calls, working behind the bar, and helping customers with any issues they may have. Efficient communication was essential due to the fact that there would only be 3 staff members running the cinema at any one time. Being part of a small team meant that I was involved in marketing ideas and am proud to say that their growth led to plans of expansion after my departure.\\
