\section*{Profile}
\vspace*{-10pt}
I am a critical thinker who is always up for learning something new, to better myself every day. My experience has taught me that openly tackling new problems 
and challenges is the best way to do this; pushing myself out of my comfort zone and giving 100\%. Throughout my degree I have combined my studies with 
other commitments to show myself to be conscientious, deadline-driven, and passionate about the industry. To kick-start my career I am looking for a graduate, 
full-stack developer position.
 
\section*{Professional Experience}
\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
2018--2019 & {\bf A2Z Cloud | Business Applications Developer.}\\
                   & Placement year taken as part of my degree. In my role I would be configuring, automating, and integrating various Zoho business applications. 
                      Initially I was developing using Zoho's Javascript-based proprietary language, \textit{Deluge}. During the last few months of my placement I was
                      developing data-mapping middlewares using NodeJS, to request data from client systems and map it to a format that their Zoho system could 
                      receive. Other responsibilities included being on-site with clients doing requirements gathering sessions, in addition to demonstrating my 
                      development progress to them over weekly online meetings.\\ [8pt]
                      
2015--2016 & {\bf The Regal Stowmarket | Customer Assisstant.}\\
                   & Part-time job during college. Responsibilities included selling box office tickets, answering calls, working behind the bar, and helping customers with any issues 
                       they may have. Efficient communication was essential due to the fact that there would only be 3 staff members running the cinema at any one time. Being part 
                       of a small team meant that I was involved in marketing ideas and am proud to say that their growth led to plans of expansion after my departure.\\

\section*{Skills Profile}
As a result of my university degree I have experience developing in a wide range of languages, environments and disciplines. The first two years of my degree were centred around building a foundation for my programming skills, using C\# and Java to demonstrate SOLID principles and implement design patterns to solve problems. As I have matured as a developer my primary interest has shifted towards full-stack web development. In my own time I started to teach myself about web development, and carried these skills into my final year at university. Since then, I have experience developing in JavaScript and TypeScript to produce APIs \& persistence layers, communicating to both MongoDB and relational databases. My front-end development experience spans the use of VueJS and Angular8, for desktop web applications and native mobile applications (including a development pipeline using Ionic and Cordova). I have experience using Git in both individual and team settings, performing and receiving pull-requests and code reviews with my colleagues.
\newline\newline
Between my second and third years of university, I was able to use the skills I had learnt in an industry environment - automating and integrating business web-applications for clients. This experience was valuable in helping me understand the wider impact that software has on businesses, in addition to putting my programming and system design skills into practice. I was given a high level of responsibility, directly demonstrating my solutions to clients over online meetings on a weekly basis. My placement gave me skills in programming and debugging in a web environment, in addition to working with APIs, databases, and building integration middleware. This middleware was often hosted on AWS which I would help configure. I would also be on the client support portal, emailing and calling clients to assist them with any problems they were experiencing. On a personal level, my placement year improved my confidence which in turn has helped with my ability to approach new challenges.
\newline\newline
In addition to the skills outlined above, I have experience using C\# to develop experience-based projects in Unity3D - allowing me to utilise my programming knowledge to make games, and VR experiences. During my final year of university I used C++ and OpenGL to build various graphics rendering applications;  a model-loader to parse and render the data for 3D model files, and an application to procedurally generate \& render virtual terrains using noise functions.

\section*{Interests}
Outside of software development I have a keen interest in reading fiction books, particularly of the crime-fiction genre. I enjoy it because it provides a way for me to be analytical and test my problem solving abilities in an atypical way. In addition, I enjoy learning about ancient history - particularly Ancient Rome and Ancient Greece, as these eras of human history are responsible for many of our traditions today. In my spare time I play guitar, which feeds into an active interest in music - something which has had a large influence on my life.
